His other interests involve gene therapy, and its potential to translate research on gene expression into tangible benefits, for individuals afflicted by congenital disorders.</p>"},{"location":"studentsandstaff/#torres-luis","title":"Torres, Luis-- PhD Student","text":"Luis Torres <p>-- luisalfredotorres@tamu.edu     -- PubMed bibliography link </p> <p>Luis Torres is a DVM who graduated from the Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez (2016).
