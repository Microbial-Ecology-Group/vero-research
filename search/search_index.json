His research focuses on the transcription and methylation of immunologically important genes, specifically in the context of bovine respiratory disease. By studying how cattle gene expression changes in response to stress, handling, and pharmaceuticals, especially in the context of disease, he hopes to detail new etiologies of multifactorial diseases in cattle. His other interests involve gene therapy, and its potential to translate research on gene expression into tangible benefits, for individuals afflicted by congenital disorders.</p>"},{"location":"studentsandstaff/#torres-luis","title":"Torres, Luis-- PhD Student","text":"Luis Torres <p>-- luisalfredotorres@tamu.edu     -- PubMed bibliography link </p> <p>Luis Torres is a DVM who graduated from the Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez (2016).
