# About VERO Research
The strategic vision of the VERO Research Team is to pursue collaborative research focusing on disease prevention and mitigation, microbial ecology, and prudent use of antimicrobial drugs and alternatives.  We emphasize the use of molecular biology and genomics in the conduct of state-of-the-art, highly-impactful research to improve the sustainability of animal agriculture in order to provide an abundant and healthy food supply. 

The [Veterinary Education, Research, & Outreach (VERO) Program](https://vetmed.tamu.edu/vero/) is a dynamic partnership between the [Texas A&M University's School of Veterinary Medicine & Biomedical Sciences (VMBS)](https://vetmed.tamu.edu) and [West Texas A&M University's College of Agriculture and Natural Sciences](https://www.wtamu.edu/academics/college-agriculture-natural-sciences/index.html).  The VERO Program is located in Canyon, TX, in the heart of one of the most productive cattle production regions in the world. Our partnerships with producers and veterinarians in this region provide unprecedented opportunities for collaborations that yield research with the highest possible impact.
