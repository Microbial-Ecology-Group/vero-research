# About VERO Research
The strategic vision of the VERO research group is to pursue collaborative research addressing the sustainability of animal agriculture in the areas of disease prevention and mitigation, food safety, prudent use of antimicrobial drugs and alternatives.  We emphasize the use of molecular biology and genomics in the conduct of state-of-the-art, hihgly impactful research to support more sustainable cattle production to provide an abundant and healthy food supply. 

The Veterinary Education, Research, & Outreach (VERO) Program is a dynamic partnership between the Texas A&M School of Veterinary Medicine & Biomedical Sciences (VMBS) and West Texas A&M University's College of Agriculture and Natural Sciences.  VERO's home is located in Canyon, TX, located in the heart of one of the most productive cattle production regions in the world. Our partnerships with producers and veterinarians in this region provides unprecedented opportunities for collaborations that yield research with the highest possible impact
