# About VERO
The strategic vision of the VERO research group is to pursue collaborative research that addresses the sustainability of animal agriculture and rural communities in the areas of disease prevention and mitigation, food safety, antimicrobial use and alternatives, genomics and other cutting edge diagnostic technologies which support more sustainable cattle production and an abundant and healthy food supply. 

The Veterinary Education, Research, & Outreach (VERO) Program is a dynamic partnership between the Texas A&M School of Veterinary Medicine & Biomedical Sciences (VMBS) and West Texas A&M University's College of Agriculture and Natural Sciences.  VERO's home is located in Canyon, TX, located in the heart of one of the most productive cattle production regions in the world. Our partnerships with producers and veterinarians in this region provides unprecedented opportunities for collaborations that yield research with the highest possible impact
