# About VERO
The strategic vision of the VERO research group is to pursue collaborative research that addresses the sustainability of animal agriculture
and rural communities in the areas of disease prevention and mitigation, food safety, antimicrobial use and alternatives, genomics
and other cutting edge diagnostic technologies which support more sustainable cattle production and an abundant and healthy
food supply. 

VERO stands for “Veterinary Education, Research, & Outreach.” It’s a dynamic partnership between the Texas A&M School of Veterinary Medicine & Biomedical Sciences (VMBS) and West Texas A&M University (WT). Set in the heart of one of the most productive animal agricultural regions in the world, VERO provides unprecedented opportunities for collaboration with industry partners and stakeholders from the region and across the nation.
