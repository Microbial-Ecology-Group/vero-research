  <div style="grid-column: 1 / span 2; grid-row: 3;">
    <p>Rebecca received her BS in Biomedical Sciences from Texas A&M University and her MS degree 2023 from the Department of Agricultural Sciences at West Texas A&M and the VERO Partnership. Her research focused on evaluating effects of various antimicrobials on the whole blood transcriptome of commercial feedlot cattle when administered as a metaphylactic treatment for bovine respiratory disease. Rebecca is currently pursuing her PhD at Kansas State University. </p>

    <p>Max received his BS in Biology from the University of Wisconsin - Green Bay in 2021. He joined Dr. Valeris’s lab in 2022 and is currently a Masters - Thesis student in the Biomedical Sciences (BIMS) program. Max’s research focuses on identifying virulence factors and antimicrobial resistance genes in <i>Salmonella</i> isolates from beef cattle in the Texas panhandle. By comparing the distribution of these pathogenicity-relevant genes among isolates, Max will advance the current knowledge on Salmonella ecology in cattle and significantly improve industry understanding of <i>Salmonella</i> capabilities to cause harm.</p>
