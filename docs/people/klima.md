## SHORT BIOGRAPHY
Dr. Cassidy Klima is an assistant professor and molecular microbiologist with VERO and the Department of Veterinary Pathobiology, School of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences (VMBS) at Texas A&M University and Texas A&M AgriLife Research.  She received her PhD in biology from the University of Saskatchewan in 2015 followed by postdoctoral fellowships at the University of Calgary and Iowa State University.  Much of her research has focused on topics relating to bovine health, surveillance and antimicrobial resistance development in zoonotic agents, and food safety.  A primary goal of her work is to examine how production practices can be optimized to reduce disease while improving animal welfare, beef quality and overall food safety.

## SHORT BIOGRAPHY
Dr. Matthew Scott is an assistant professor for #TeamVERO through the Department of Large Animal Clinical Sciences within the School of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences. Before joining #TeamVERO in the summer of 2021, he received his DVM in 2018 and a PhD in Veterinary Medical Science â€“ Infectious Diseases in 2021, both from Mississippi State University. Much of his research and professional activities relate to investigating the relationships between host immunity, microbial ecosystems, and cattle management programs, centered on clinical bovine respiratory disease (BRD). These activities are in the aim to develop pipelines and tools that would mitigate risk of disease in food production settings, such as feedlots.
