## SHORT BIOGRAPHY
Enrique is a postdoctoral researcher working with Dr. Paul Morley and other VERO researchers at Texas A&M University. Enrique received his veterinary degree in May 2022 from the Colorado State University College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences. At the same institution, Enrique completed his PhD in veterinary epidemiology in May 2019 with Dr. Paul Morley. Enrique holds a bachelorâ€™s degree in Animal Sciences from Auburn University. Enrique's research employs high-throughput sequencing to characterize microbial communities (the microbiome) and the profile of resistance genes they carry (resistome) to better understand the effect of antimicrobial drug use in agricultural production settings. His goal is to contribute an applied interpretation of statistical analyses and help translate research into practical livestock management techniques to address the tenets of One Health; optimal health for people, animals, and the environment.
