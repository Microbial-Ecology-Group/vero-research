## SHORT BIOGRAPHY
Dr. Paul Morley was appointed Professor and Director of Research at VERO in 2019, and was named the Sally Rau McIntosh Endowed Chair for Veterinary Strategic Initiatives at Texas A&M University in 2022.  VERO - the Veterinary Education, Research & Outreach Program -- is an initiative of the Texas A&M University's School of Veterinary Medicine conducted in partnership with West Texas A&M University. Dr. Morley is an epidemiologist, animal scientist, and veterinary internal medicine specialist who studies infectious diseases affecting animals and people. Currently, his research uses advanced molecular tools to investigate health and disease pathogenesis in animals, methods for disease prevention and mitigation, microbial ecology, and impacts of antimicrobial drug use.  The goal of these efforts is to conduct state-of-the-art, highly impactful research to improve sustainability of animal agriculture in order to provide an abundant and healthy food supply. He previously served for 20 years as Professor of Epidemiology at Colorado State University and the Colorado School of Public Health, and as the Director of Infection Control at the James L. Voss Veterinary Teaching Hospital. He is a recognized authority on infection control in animal populations and has consulted on infection control and biosecurity issues at veterinary hospitals, veterinary colleges, and animal production facilities around the world.
