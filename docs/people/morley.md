## SHORT BIOGRAPHY
Dr. Paul Morley is a professor and director of food animal research for #TeamVERO through the Department of Large Animal Clinical Sciences (VLCS) in the CVMBS. Dr. Morley is an epidemiologist, animal scientist, and veterinary internal medicine specialist who studies infectious diseases affecting animals and people. In 2022, he was named the Sally Rau McIntosh Endowed Chair for Strategic Initiatives at Texas A&M University. Major areas of emphasis for his research include antimicrobial resistance in animals and food production systems, disease pathogenesis, and population-based approaches for understanding and manage health risks that are important in veterinary medicine, agriculture, and public health. In 2019, he was appointed the Director of Research for VERO - the Veterinary Education, Research & Outreach Program â€“ in the School of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences at Texas A&M University. Previously, Dr. Morley served for 20 years as Professor of Epidemiology and the Director of Infection Control at Colorado State University and the Colorado School of Public Health. He is a recognized authority on infection control in animal populations and has consulted on infection control and biosecurity issues at veterinary hospitals, veterinary colleges, and animal production facilities around the world.
