## RESEARCH AND SCHOLARLY INTERESTS



My research interests include the study of the ecology and epidemiology of respiratory bacterial pathogens affecting food animals and the development and evaluation of antibiotic alternatives that could potentially be used as prevention or control strategies, especially those involving the modulation of the microbiome.

## SHORT BIOGRAPHY
I am an epidemiologist interested in the use of antibiotic alternatives for the prevention and control of infectious diseases in food animal production systems, such as bovine respiratory disease in beef and dairy cattle.
