## SHORT BIOGRAPHY
Dr. Matthew Scott is an assistant professor for #TeamVERO through the Department of Large Animal Clinical Sciences (VLCS) within the School of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences (SVMBS). Before joining #TeamVERO in the summer of 2021, he received his DVM in 2018 and a PhD in Veterinary Medical Science – Infectious Diseases in 2021, both from Mississippi State University. Much of his research and professional activities relate to investigating the relationships between host immunity, microbial ecosystems, and cattle management programs, centered on clinical bovine respiratory disease (BRD). These activities are in the aim to develop pipelines and tools that would mitigate risk of disease in food production settings, such as feedlots.
