    <p>Dr. Paul Morley is a professor and director of food animal research for #TeamVERO through the Department of Large Animal Clinical Sciences (VLCS) in the CVMBS. He is an epidemiologist and veterinary internal medicine specialist who studies infectious diseases affecting people and animals. Major emphases for his professional activities include investigating the ecology of antimicrobial resistance in animals and food production systems, using analytical epidemiology to improve our understanding of diseases in animals and people, and improving infection control and biosecurity to manage health risks that are important in veterinary medicine, agriculture, and public health. His research has used shotgun metagenomics to investigate the influence of production practices in intensive agriculture systems on antimicrobial resistance and microbial ecology as these affect human, animal, and ecosystem health.</p>

    <h3> Assistant Professor of Microbial Ecology & Infectious Disease (VLCS – VERO)</h3>
  </div>
  <div style="grid-column: 1 / span 2; grid-row: 3;">
    <p>Dr. Matthew Scott is an assistant professor for #TeamVERO through the Department of Large Animal Clinical Sciences (VLCS) within the School of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences (SVMBS). Before joining #TeamVERO in the summer of 2021, he received his DVM in 2018 and a PhD in Veterinary Medical Science – Infectious Diseases in 2021, both from Mississippi State University. Much of his research and professional activities relate to investigating the relationships between host immunity, microbial ecosystems, and cattle management programs, centered on clinical bovine respiratory disease (BRD). These activities are in the aim to develop pipelines and tools that would mitigate risk of disease in food production settings, such as feedlots.</p>
